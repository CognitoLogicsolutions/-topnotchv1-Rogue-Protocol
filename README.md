## 💼 Executive Summary
The **Rogue Protocol** is a sovereign engineering framework developed independently to maintain data integrity in adversarial digital environments. 

This repository serves as the public technical specification and proof-of-concept for the **v1.1 Sovereign Bridge**, specifically designed to bypass the **February 2026 Google API deprecations** (Keep/Ads/Session restrictions).

## 🛡️ 2026 Compliance & Security
As of Feb 2, 2026, third-party infrastructure has restricted legacy sync protocols. This protocol executes a "Clean-Room" data flow:
* **Metadata Purge:** Automatically strips restricted Session (S) and IP (I) data.
* **Reroute:** Transitions legacy Keep "Reminders" to the 2026 Tasks API Protocol.
* **Sovereign Bridge:** Maintains 100% uptime when standard sync returns 404/Deprecated.

---

## 🔄 The Core Loop (Logic Flow)
The protocol operates via a repetitive, text-validated cycle:
1. **Sense** – Intake of signals and environment states.
2. **Verify** – Cross-referencing via **Reliability Weighting ($w$)**. 
3. **Decide** – Sovereign-priority logic: $Sovereign (0.9) > Provider (0.1)$.
4. **Act** – Execution with verified rollback pathways.
5. **Log** – Tamper-proof timestamped audit trail.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap
* **v1.1 (Current):** Formal JSON schemas for logs and 2026 compliance.
* **v1.2:** Repeatable AI-assisted reasoning workflows.
* **v2.0:** Governance framework inspired by WHO-level transparency standards.
